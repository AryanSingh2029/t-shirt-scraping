# üß¢ Multi-Brand Product Price Aggregator

This project is a **T-shirt Price Aggregator** built using **Python, Streamlit**, and **Playwright**. It scrapes and displays products from three popular Indian fashion websites:

- **BluOrng**
- **Bewakoof**
- **Souled Store**

Users can search for T-shirts and view details such as product name, brand, price, link, and image ‚Äî all in a clean, responsive grid layout.

---

## üîç Features

- Scrapes real-time data from 3 fashion sites using **Playwright**
- Filters and shows only valid product entries with images
- Displays products in a 3-column responsive card layout
- Highlights total products fetched
- Excludes products with missing or placeholder images
- Includes basic insights: cheapest and costliest product (if enabled)
- Works perfectly on **local machines**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Each site has its own scraper script under the `scrapers/` directory:
- `bluorng.py` ‚Äî fetches products using Shopify JSON endpoint
- `bewakoof.py` ‚Äî uses Playwright to render JS content and scrape cards
- `souledstore.py` ‚Äî also uses Playwright to scrape rendered product tiles

The main `app.py` handles:
- UI input via Streamlit
- Calling each scraper using `subprocess`
- Merging results into a unified view
- Filtering products missing images
- Optional price-based analysis

## üöÄ You can this repo  Locally
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Python 3.10+ and Chrome installed (Playwright uses Chromium)
1. Clone this repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AryanSingh2029/t-shirt-scraping.git
   cd t-shirt-scraping

2.Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install

3. Run the Streamlit app
 streamlit run app.py

4.search for t-shirt



‚ö†Ô∏è Why It Doesn‚Äôt Work on Streamlit Cloud
This app uses Playwright, which launches a real browser instance (Chromium) to scrape dynamic JavaScript content.

‚úÖ Works on local machine
‚ùå Not supported on Streamlit Cloud because it doesn‚Äôt allow launching browsers like Chromium (used by Playwright).
